The goal for this ticket was to get feedback from the users and in order to do so a step by step rating/feedback mechanism has been written down.
Given that the user will be providing feedback for the essay, it seemed more sensible to postion the review options after the essay component rather than before it to have a more natural flow of the page, it would have been a bad user experience to scroll back up in order to fill out the review form.
Other than a review option for those who provide perfect ratings, an internal feedback textarea has been added to capture the feedback of those who might want to suggest improvements.

NOTE FOR THE DEVELOPER:
The third party & internal feedback handling methods have been written within the "Ratings" component which can be found at "/src/componnents/Ratings/Ratings.tsx".
The remaining tasks are as follows:
-Store the textarea alongside the ratings when user clicks on the submit button (Hint: Use a form)
-Display a thank you message to the user upon providing feedback (Hint: Use a Modal or Toast)
